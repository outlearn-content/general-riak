# Prep your mind and machine

Now that you’ve seen an example use case from Kiip, let’s get started with the details of Riak. The next module will give you a sense of the way of thinking used by Riak. If you’re more familiar with relational or document oriented databases, this will help you wrap your head around key-value databases. And even if you’re all comfortable with key-value databases, you will probably benefit from a quick review of the jargon used with Riak.

After getting your mind ready to think and speak the Riak way, you’ll prep your machine with a local installation of Riak.

Good luck and remember to try things out for yourself!
