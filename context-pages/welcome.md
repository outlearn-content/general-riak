# Welcome

Hi team.  Welcome to Diving into Riak!

SuperMegaCorp is getting into Riak big time for our database needs and I want to make sure the whole team is on the same page about it. I've worked with John and our friends at Outlearn to put together this path that will cover all the fundamentals.

The core of the path comes from the official docs but but we also also spiced things up with some other third party resources. Inside the modules there are many small and some larger tasks. The idea is that you can get your hands dirty and really apply what you learn. Do try them out and when you get stuck, ask one of the other people going through the path. If you can't figure it out together, feel free to reach out to me.

I would love to hear any feedback about the path so we can keep on making it better. And since the content is all on Github, if you want to improve something directly, go ahead and submit a pull request!

Good luck!

Bob Loblaw - VP Eng, SuperMegaCorp
