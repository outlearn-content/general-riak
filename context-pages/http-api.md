# Just testing things out

In prod we use Python to do our Riak magic. But when you just want to test something out real quick, the HTTP API that you can use with curl is your best bet. That's why the next few modules will get you familiar with the HTTP API so that you can use it for quick testing and prototyping while you develop in Python.

Happy hacking!
