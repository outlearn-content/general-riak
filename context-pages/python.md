# Diving in with Python

The rest of the path is devoted to get you ready to use Riak through the Python API. You’ll learn about Riak CRUD operations, querying, and object modeling.

In the Python modules more than in any of the others, it’ll be super helpful for you to make sure you understand what you read and complete the tasks included in the modules. This will include some tasks where you will send in a deliverable such as a piece of code that you wrote. The idea is to help you get your hands dirty and put things to practice right away. That way you’ll learn quicker and remember what you learned more easily.

Good luck!
