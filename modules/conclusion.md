Well done, you've covered a lot of ground. The key things you learned in this path are:

- Compare Riak with other NoSQL databases and also compare it with relational databases
- Install Riak on your own machine
- Perform CRUD operations in Python
- Use Python to query a Riak database
- Create Riak object models
- Use the HTTP API to perform operations related to buckets, objects, queries, servers, and searches.
- Use Riak with Clojure


<!-- @section, "title": "Here is what you now should be able to do" -->

To put all of this into practice, we expect that you are ready to do the following:

- Create additional buckets
- Model key-value pairs according to real-life data needs
- Perform basic maintenance on a Riak data store.
