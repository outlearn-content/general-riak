We'll kick things of with an overview from Basho on what Riak is good at. Next in line will be a case study of from Kiip and how they use Riak to connect advertisers and app makers.

The next two Modules will help you get an overview of the concepts underlying Riak as well as get a working environment up and running. We'll then dive right into using Python for CRUD operations, querying, and object modeling.


# Here is what you be able to do

The focus of this Path is on giving you new skills that you can put into practice. After completing all the Modules in the Path, you will be able to:

- Compare Riak with other NoSQL databases and also compare it with relational databases
- Install Riak on your own machine
- Perform CRUD operations in Python
- Use Python to query a Riak database
- Create Riak object models


# Expectations for time commitment

Part of the beauty of online learning is that you can time it flexibly. But you do need to put in serious effort to get most out of this Path. Everyone learns differently and some people like to skim things quickly and come back later while others dig deep at first go. We think that you'll need an average of 15 hours to get through this path, including completing the tasks included in the modules.

# Prerequisites

This path assumes that you already know Python and have a general idea of how databases work.
